    "\nHi Ryan,\n\nThank you for your inquiry. I checked with our warehouse team, and unfortunately, we\u2019re unable to recommend cross-using parts between manufacturers. Since we don\u2019t sell Norton heaters, we don\u2019t have compatible parts to recommend for your setup.\n\nIf there\u2019s anything else you need assistance with, feel free to reach out!\n\nSincerely,\nCristian\nthesaunaheater.com"
