I'm calling about an issue I've been having with my SaunaLife X7.\n\nCustomer Service Representative (Roger): Hello Mike! I'm sorry to hear that you're having issues. Can you please tell me more about what's going on?\n\nMike: Yes, I received the sauna a couple of weeks ago, and I've noticed several problems. For starters, the hinges on the door have some noticeable scrapes, and the build quality seems quite poor.\n\nRoger: I see. That sounds frustrating. Can you describe any specific issues with the sauna's structure?\n\nMike: Definitely. The frontmost side panel is warped, which is causing some torque on the window panels. There’s also a significant gap at the upper door edge which makes it hard to maintain heat.\n\nRoger: I'm really sorry to hear that. It sounds like this is affecting your sauna experience. Have you taken any photos of the issues?\n\nMike: Yes, I have photos of the scrapes, the warped panel, and the gaps. I can send those over once we’re done here.\n\nRoger: That would be very helpful. If you can send the photos to our support email, we can forward them to the manufacturer for their review.\n\nMike: I’d appreciate that. I’d like to know what options I have for getting this resolved. Ideally, I would want a partial refund or a replacement for the faulty parts.\n\nRoger: I understand your concerns, Mike. Once we receive the photos and details, we will do our best to expedite a resolution for you. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss today?\n\nMike: No, that covers it for now. Thank you for your help.\n\nRoger: You're welcome! Thank you for reaching out, and we look forward to resolving this for you. Have a great day!\n\nMike: You too, goodbye!"],

How can I assist you today?\n\nMikey: Hi Sarah, this is Mikey. I have some questions about the HUUM Drop 4.5kW sauna heater.\n\nCSR: Hi Mikey! I’d be happy to help you with that. What would you like to know?\n\nMikey: Well, first off, can you tell me what the electrical requirements are for the HUUM Drop 4.5?\n\nCSR: Sure! The HUUM Drop 4.5kW requires a 240V AC power supply or a 208V AC option. For the 240V, it has a current of 18.75 amps, and you'll need a 30 amp circuit breaker with a 10 AWG wire size. If you’re using the 208V option, it requires 16.35 amps with a 20 amp circuit breaker and a 12 AWG wire size.\n\nMikey: That sounds good. Do I need any additional accessories to run the heater?\n\nCSR: Yes, you'll need a control panel and stones for the heater to function properly. We recommend specific types of stones that can handle the heat well.\n\nMikey: Got it! Can you also tell me about the installation? Is it something I can do myself, or do I need a professional?\n\nCSR: It's highly recommended that a certified electrician handles the installation to ensure safety and compliance with electrical codes. They will also be able to assist with any necessary connections.\n\nMikey: That makes sense. Is there a package deal for everything I need to get started?\n\nCSR: Yes, we can provide you with a package quote that includes the HUUM Drop 4.5kW heater, the control panel, and the recommended stones.\n\nMikey: That would be great! When can I expect to receive that quote?\n\nCSR: I can send that over to you within the next 24 hours. Could you please provide me with your email address?\n\nMikey: Sure, it’s mikey@example.com.\n\nCSR: Thank you, Mikey! I’ll make sure to send the quote to that email. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?\n\nMikey: No, that’s all for now. Thanks for your help, Sarah!\n\nCSR: You’re welcome! Thank you for calling, and have a great day!\n\nMikey: You too, bye!\n\nCSR: Bye!"],
    "+14047241937": ["Customer Service Rep (CSR): Thank you for calling The Sauna Heater Company, this is Cristian speaking. How can I assist you today?\n\nCustomer: Hi Cristian, I recently purchased the HUUM Drop 4.5kW heater, and I’m having a problem. It’s not heating my sauna at all.\n\nCSR: I’m really sorry to hear that you’re having trouble with the heater. Let’s see if we can troubleshoot the issue together. Can you please tell me the dimensions of your sauna?\n\nCustomer: Sure! It’s 7 feet by 7 feet by 7 feet.\n\nCSR: Thank you for that information. The HUUM Drop 4.5kW heater is designed for saunas with a maximum volume of around 212 cubic feet. Your sauna's dimensions suggest it's about 343 cubic feet. That’s a bit larger than what the heater is rated for, which might explain why it’s not heating effectively.\n\nCustomer: Oh, I see. I didn’t realize that. So, it might just not be powerful enough for the size of my sauna?\n\nCSR: Exactly. It sounds like the heater may simply not have the capacity to heat your sauna adequately. Have you had a chance to check the connections and make sure that everything is set up properly? Sometimes a loose connection can cause issues as well.\n\nCustomer: I haven’t checked that yet. I’m a bit new to installing sauna heaters, so I might need to review the manual.\n\nCSR: That’s completely understandable! I can help you with that. Would you like me to send you a copy of the manual for the HUUM Drop? It can guide you through the setup process and troubleshooting steps.\n\nCustomer: Yes, that would be great. I’d appreciate that.\n\nCSR: Alright, I’ll send that over to your email right after our call. In the meantime, if you find that the connections are secure and the settings are correct but it’s still not heating, we can look into other options, like upgrading to a more powerful heater that would be better suited for your sauna size.\n\nCustomer: That makes sense. I’ll definitely check everything and review the manual.\n\nCSR: Fantastic! Just take your time with it, and if you still run into issues or have more questions, don’t hesitate to reach out. We’re here to help!\n\nCustomer: Thank you, Cristian. I really appreciate your assistance. I’ll get back to you if it’s still not working after I check everything.\n\nCSR: You’re welcome! I hope it gets resolved soon. Have a great day, and I’ll be here if you need anything else!\n\nCustomer: You too, thanks!\n\nCSR: Goodbye!"],
